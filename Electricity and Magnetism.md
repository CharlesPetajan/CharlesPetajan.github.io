# Coulomb

This one is easy. The force of repulsion between two point charges is proportional to both point charges and square-inversely proportional to the distance between them.

$$ 
F_{Coulomb} = k \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{R^2}
$$

where k is a constant that depends on units. This law is more useful that forces between point charges, since we can either approximate small sections of voluminous charges as points for numerical computation, or we can integrate over infinitesimal point charges across voluminous charges for a pen and paper analysis.

# Gauss

This law requires good set up to create the symmetry necessary for useful results. The idea is that the integral of the electric field over a closed, 3D surface will be proportional to the charge enclosed in the 3D surface.

Integral Form
$$
\oint_{\partial V} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

Differential Form
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

The integral here is really a good "reason" for Coulomb's inverse square relationship, because the area of a sphere is proportional to its radius squared, so the electric field at a point from a point charge is equal to the supposed point charge in the middle of the sphere an imaginary sphere with an edge touching our point divided by the area of the sphere.
