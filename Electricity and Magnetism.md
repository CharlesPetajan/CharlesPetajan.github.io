# Coulomb

This one is easy. The force of repulsion between two point charges is proportional to both point charges and square-inversely proportional to the distance between them.

$$ 
F_{Coulomb} = k \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{R^2}
$$

where k is a constant that depends on units. This law is more useful that forces between point charges, since we can either approximate small sections of voluminous charges as points for numerical computation or we can integrate over infinitesimal point charges across voluminous charges for a pen and paper analysis.
